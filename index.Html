            <p>I have a cure for insomnia. It’s probably worth millions of dollars but I’m giving it to you free. It isn’t warm milk or chamomile tea. It’s list making. List stuff from your life like all your teachers or all the live music you’ve seen or all the Paul Newman movies you’ve watched.Every free country has a special symbol, and that symbol is its flag! Our Bangladeshi flag stands for our independence, our strength as a united people, and our right to rule ourselves. We earned this flag in 1971 after a hard fight for freedom.

            The flag itself is a simple design. Imagine a long rectangle, like a door, but wider than it is tall. This rectangle is a deep green color, like the lush fields of our country. In the middle of the green, there’s a big red circle, almost like the sun rising in the morning. This red circle is special – it’s exactly one-fifth the length of the whole flag!

            <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>
